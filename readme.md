# <p align="center">ATTENDANCE RECORDING BOT</p>

### <p align="right">-Team TechnoVision</p>

For the Institute Technical Summer Project-2018, our team intends to build an Attendance Recording Bot to record the attendance of all the students present that day who have registered for the course. 

In order to tackle the loopholes in the current methods of manual attendance and introduce tech in various schools and colleges, we came up with this idea to make a bot that could use face recognition to mark the attendance of students while they are sitting for the lecture. We are also planning to create an app for the students such that they get to check their attendance and also receive a notification immediately when the bot records their attendance.

We would like to start for a small classroom with not many students to test this idea of ours.
